							El Stitch y Bitch is a fluid fiber collective based in the Pilsen, Bridgeport and Little Village neighborhoods of Chicago. We are a group of 20-30 mostly Latina women who range in age and artistic background. Some of us are formally trained artists and teachers, while others are self taught or continuing the craft traditions of our mothers and grandmothers. While we meet regularly to knit and sew together in public places, we have also collaborated on textile installations for the Mexican Museum of Fine Arts, the Milwaukee Latino Cultural Center and other venues. Our pieces bring traditional craft techniques like quilting, crochet and embroidery into fine art settings.

					<p class="museum-label-description">Molly Roth mines text and context, sentimentality, estrangement, and the quotidian as fodder to create works that are both beautiful and awkward. Through accumulation and careful consideration, Roth converts banal words and materials into decorative, self-describing statements on anxiety, nostalgia, value, and control. Her labor-intensive, text-based works vary from large-scale installations to paintings to small collage/drawings on newspaper and chipboard.  Often disguising the written word inside of itself, she adorns it with obsessive decoration or covers it up with common materials.  Molly lives and works in Chicago, Illinois. </p>

					<p class="museum-label-description">Abigail Heuss is a metalsmith and an object maker. She is fascinated by jewelry and household items because they are objects of intimacy. She makes vessels, reliquaries and jewelry because she wants her work to be handled. She is drawn to stories about how we connect to each other, and the cultures, and physical spaces we inhabit. She chooses her materials based on the story she wants to illustrate, often drawn to materials like paper, fabric, wood and found objects. She treasures the preciousness of ordinary things, the way objects patina with use and evolve to fit their owners. The things we own help to define us and we do the same for them. </p>
