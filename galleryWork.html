					<p class="museum-label-description">Molly Roth mines text and context, sentimentality, estrangement, and the quotidian as fodder to create works that are both beautiful and awkward. Through accumulation and careful consideration, Roth converts banal words and materials into decorative, self-describing statements on anxiety, nostalgia, value, and control. Her labor-intensive, text-based works vary from large-scale installations to paintings to small collage/drawings on newspaper and chipboard.  Often disguising the written word inside of itself, she adorns it with obsessive decoration or covers it up with common materials.  Molly lives and works in Chicago, Illinois. </p>
